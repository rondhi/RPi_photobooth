RPi_photobooth
==============

These files are supplied as part of an [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-photo-booth-controller/) that describes how to build a photobooth using a Raspberry Pi as the "brains" of a camera, printer, and user interface controller.

This is a modified version of safay's Raspberry Pi Photobooth. This code also uses a python script to upload photos to Google Drive, located here: https://github.com/rondhi/GDriveUpload/blob/master/upload.py
